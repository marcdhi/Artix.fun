<p align="center">Meme Contest DAO Platform</p>

---

## üìå Project Description

Artix.fun is a **Web3-based meme contest DAO platform** where memes created by users are **evaluated through on-chain voting**, automatically minted as **NFTs via AI agents**, and promoted through **viral marketing** on social media.

In the past, meme creators **did not receive proper recognition or rewards**, even if their memes went viral. Artix.fun addresses this issue by providing **DAO voting, NFT-based ownership verification, AI-powered marketing automation, and a meme utilization reward system**, creating an environment where **creators and the community can grow together**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Statement

1. **Lack of rewards for meme creators**
    - Many memes become widely popular, but **the original creator does not receive financial benefits or recognition**.
    - There is **no way to prove ownership** of a meme.
2. **Lack of meme valuation and on-chain records**
    - Memes are shared and disappear without being **recorded as digital assets**.
    - There is no proper **on-chain system to evaluate and reward memes**.
3. **Inefficiency in meme viral marketing**
    - Memes spread mainly through community sharing, but **there is no structured system to promote them effectively**.
4. **No rewards for community participants**
    - Users who **vote or help memes go viral do not receive any benefits**.

## üí° Solution

1. **On-chain DAO voting system to select the most popular memes**
    - All users can vote for memes, and **the meme that reaches the highest vote count is automatically selected**.
2. **AI-powered NFT minting & social media promotion**
    - The winning meme is **automatically minted as an NFT**, ensuring **the creator‚Äôs ownership**.
    - The **AI agent promotes the meme on social media (Twitter, etc.)**, maximizing its exposure.
3. **Reward system for DAO voters**
    - Users who participate in DAO voting can **freely use the selected meme**.
    - If the creator later launches a **token related to the meme, voters get whitelisted**.
    - If no token is launched, **users receive reward points on our platform**.
4. **Ranking NFT system for voter participation**
    - Users can accumulate points and **mint their own NFTs**.
    - These NFTs display **which memes the user voted for, how much they contributed, and their ranking**.
    - This creates a **leaderboard system** where users can track their voting influence.
